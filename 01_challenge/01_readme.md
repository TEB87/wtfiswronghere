Ran the script in IDLE which gave me a syntax error. It also highlighted in red where the error occurred.

I compared the line of code to another line of code in the script that was trying to accomplish the same task. I was just looking for a discrepancy between the two lines of code.

I learned how to use Github, partially at least. This challenge is helping me learn the lingo github uses.
